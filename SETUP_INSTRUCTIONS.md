└── SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md  # This file
```

## Required Image Files

The following image files need to be created manually:

1. `src/images/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
2. `src/images/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
3. `src/images/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)
4. `src/images/logo.png` (40x40 pixels)

These images should follow a yellowish theme as requested.

## Testing the Extension

To test the extension:

1. Create the required image files listed above
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files
5. The extension should now be installed and visible in your browser toolbar

## API Integration

The extension is configured to use the [waktusolat.app](https://api.waktusolat.app/docs) API to fetch prayer times. The API endpoints used are:

- `GET /{location}`: Retrieve daily times for a valid location (e.g., `/Kuala%20Lumpur`)
- `GET /zone`: Validate user's location against supported zones

## Next Steps

1. Create the required image files
2. Test the extension in Chrome
3. Make any necessary adjustments to the code
4. Consider implementing additional features mentioned in the PRD:
   - Weekly/Monthly view
   - Design themes (light/dark mode)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the API endpoints are accessible
3. Ensure all required files are in the correct locations
